# QBMET TMC 429 Controller Code

This is the motor control code for the Queen's University BioMechatronics Team.

It includes some files provided by Trinamic that are nearly impossible to find.

I was able to find them using a broken link from an old store listing and the WayBack Machine.

If you're reading this right now, the code in the [trinamic_resources](./trinamic_resources/) folder is untouched from how it was written.
